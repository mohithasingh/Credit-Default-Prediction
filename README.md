**Credit Default Prediction using XGBoost (SQL & Python)**  

This project builds a predictive model to assess credit default risk using one year of financial data. It employs feature engineering, one-hot encoding, and feature selection to refine over 200 attributes into key predictive variables. XGBoost, known for its high accuracy and efficiency, is used to train the model, with SHAP analysis providing insights into feature impact. The model is fine-tuned using grid search, outlier treatment, and feature scaling, ensuring optimal performance. AUC scores guide model selection, and a strategic approach determines risk thresholds for decision-making.
